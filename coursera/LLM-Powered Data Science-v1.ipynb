Instead, using a module-level dictionary (`DATAFRAME_CACHE`) that lives outside any function creates a persistent storage space that all tools can access without explicitly passing it around.

    "These tools provide specialized functionality for building and evaluating machine learning models on datasets. The agent will first analyze the dataset structure using previous tools to determine if the prediction task is classification or regression. Then, based on its assessment, it will call either `evaluate_classification_dataset` or `evaluate_regression_dataset`, providing the appropriate dataset filename and target column. Both tools handle the technical aspects of machine learning (splitting the data, training the model, and calculating performance metrics) while abstracting away implementation details. For classification tasks, the agent will examine the target column's data type and unique values to determine if it's categorical, then call the classification evaluator, which returns accuracy metrics. For regression tasks involving continuous numerical predictions, the agent will select the regression evaluator that returns the R² score and mean squared error. This decision-making process showcases how a well-designed agent can choose the appropriate tool based on data characteristics, demonstrating intelligent workflow automation.\n"

    "## Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents in LangChain are advanced components that enable AI models to decide when and how to use tools dynamically. Instead of relying on predefined scripts, agents analyze user queries and choose the best tools to achieve a goal. The next step is defining your agent, which requires specifying how it should think and behave. You'll use `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages()` to create a structured prompt with three essential components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **System message**: This establishes the agent's identity and primary objective. You define it as a data science assistant whose task is to analyze CSV files and determine whether each dataset is suitable for classification or regression based on its structure. This gives the agent a clear purpose and scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User input**: The `{input}` placeholder will be replaced with the user's actual query. This allows the agent to respond directly to what the user is asking about.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Agent scratchpad**: The `{agent_scratchpad}` placeholder is crucial for tool-calling agents as it provides space for the agent to show its reasoning process and track intermediate steps. This enables the agent to build a chain of thought, call tools sequentially, and use the results from one tool to inform decisions about subsequent tool calls.\n",
