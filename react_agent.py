Create ReAct agentÂ¶
Now that you have installed the required packages and set your environment variables, we can code our ReAct agent!

Define graph stateÂ¶
We are going to define the most basic ReAct state in this example, which will just contain a list of messages.

For your specific use case, feel free to add any other state keys that you need.

"""
Define nodes and edgesÂ¶
Next let's define our nodes and edges. In our basic ReAct agent there are only two nodes, one for calling the model
and one for using tools, however you can modify this basic structure to work better for your use case. 
The tool node we define here is a simplified version of the prebuilt ToolNode, which has some additional features.

Perhaps you want to add a node for adding structured output or a node for executing some 
external action (sending an email, adding a calendar event, etc.). 
Maybe you just want to change the way the call_model node works and how should_continue decides whether 
to call tools - the possibilities are endless and LangGraph makes it easy to customize 
this basic structure for your specific use case.
"""

    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return "end"
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    else:
        return "continue"


"""
Define the graphÂ¶
Now that we have defined all of our nodes and edges, we can define and compile our graph. 
Depending on if you have added more nodes or different edges, you will need to edit this to fit your specific use case.
"""
# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("tools", tool_node)

# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.set_entry_point("agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    # First, we define the start node. We use `agent`.
    # This means these are the edges taken after the `agent` node is called.
    "agent",
    # Next, we pass in the function that will determine which node is called next.
    should_continue,
    # Finally we pass in a mapping.
    # The keys are strings, and the values are other nodes.
    # END is a special node marking that the graph should finish.
    # What will happen is we will call `should_continue`, and then the output of that
    # will be matched against the keys in this mapping.
    # Based on which one it matches, that node will then be called.
    {
        # If `tools`, then we call the tool node.
        "continue": "tools",
        # Otherwise we finish.
        "end": END,
    },
)

# We now add a normal edge from `tools` to `agent`.
# This means that after `tools` is called, `agent` node is called next.

# Now we can compile and visualize our graph
